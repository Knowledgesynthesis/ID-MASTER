- Hepatitis B & C (screening, diagnosis, treatment principles)  
- Infective endocarditis (revisited but ID-focused: organisms, source tracking, empiric logic)  
- Osteomyelitis & septic arthritis  
- Cellulitis, abscess, necrotizing fasciitis  
- STIs (syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis)  
- UTI & pyelonephritis

# **6. Infectious Disease Reasoning Framework**

Universal ID logic:
1. Identify severity (sepsis, shock).  
2. Determine if source is likely skin, lung, urine, CNS, abdomen, hardware.  
3. Order first-line diagnostics (cultures, imaging as needed).  
4. Apply pathogen-pattern recognition.  
5. Use empiric therapy logic conceptually (no dosing).  
6. Identify red flags requiring escalation (nec fasc, meningitis, endocarditis).  
7. Reassess frequently for deterioration or source control needs.  
8. Transition to chronic/long-term plans (HIV, hepatitis).  

**Pitfalls to avoid:**
- Misclassifying nec fasc as cellulitis  
- Overusing D-dimer/CT in low-risk infection contexts  
- Failing to draw cultures before antibiotics (educational point)  
- Misreading HBV serologies  
- Confusing PID with UTI symptoms  
- Missing septic arthritis  
- Not recognizing HIV OI patterns by CD4 range
